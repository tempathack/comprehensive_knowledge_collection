        "- Explain what ElastiCache is\n",

        "- Show a simple pseudo-code example using the AWS SDK\n",

        "## What ElastiCache is\n",
        "**Amazon ElastiCache** is AWS’s fully managed **in-memory data store** service. It provides managed deployments of:\n",
        "- **Redis** (including replication groups, clustering, persistence options, and high availability features)\n",
        "- **Memcached** (simple, multi-node, in-memory caching)\n",
        "\n",
        "AWS manages provisioning, patching, monitoring, scaling operations, and integrates with VPC networking/security (subnets, security groups).\n",
        "\n",
        "## What it is practically used for\n",
        "ElastiCache is used when you want **very low-latency reads/writes** (often sub-millisecond) for **non-primary** data that is:\n",
        "- **Derived** from another source (e.g., database query results)\n",
        "- **Temporary** (e.g., sessions)\n",
        "- **Fast-moving** (e.g., counters, leaderboards)\n",
        "\n",
        "Common practical use cases and patterns:\n",
        "- **Cache-aside** (a.k.a. lazy loading): read from cache first; on miss, read from DB and populate cache with a TTL\n",
        "- **Session store** for web apps (especially for horizontally scaled stateless app servers)\n",
        "- **Rate limiting / throttling** (atomic counters)\n",
        "- **Leaderboards & real-time metrics** (sorted sets, counters)\n",
        "- **Pub/Sub and lightweight queues** (Redis features)\n",
        "- **ML/serving**: cache features, embeddings, and inference responses to reduce latency and backend load\n",
        "\n",
        "## Using ElastiCache with the AWS SDK (pseudo-code)\n",
        "The **AWS SDK** is typically used to **provision and manage** ElastiCache resources and to **discover endpoints**. To actually read/write cached values you connect to the Redis/Memcached endpoint using a **protocol client** (Redis or Memcached library).\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# PSEUDO-CODE (do not run)\n",
        "\n",
        "import boto3\n",
        "# from redis import Redis  # example protocol client library\n",
        "\n",
        "# 1) Use the AWS SDK to discover your cache endpoint (example: Redis replication group)\n",
        "elasticache = boto3.client(\"elasticache\", region_name=\"us-east-1\")\n",
        "\n",
        "resp = elasticache.describe_replication_groups(\n",
        "    ReplicationGroupId=\"my-redis-rg\",\n",
        ")\n",
        "\n",
        "primary = resp[\"ReplicationGroups\"][0][\"NodeGroups\"][0][\"PrimaryEndpoint\"]\n",
        "redis_host = primary[\"Address\"]\n",
        "redis_port = primary[\"Port\"]\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2) Connect to Redis (must have network access to the VPC/subnets/security group)\n",
        "cache = Redis(host=redis_host, port=redis_port, ssl=True, password=\"...\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3) Use a common pattern: cache-aside\n",
        "key = f\"user_profile:{user_id}\"\n",
        "\n",
        "value = cache.get(key)\n",
        "if value is None:\n",
        "    value = database.query_user_profile(user_id)\n",
        "    cache.set(key, value, ex=300)  # TTL (seconds)\n",
        "\n",
        "return value\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Notes\n",
        "- ElastiCache is commonly deployed **inside a VPC**; access is controlled by **subnets + security groups**.\n",
        "- Use **TTLs** and an invalidation strategy that matches your freshness requirements.\n",
        "- For higher availability with Redis, use **replication groups** with **Multi-AZ** and automatic failover.\n"
