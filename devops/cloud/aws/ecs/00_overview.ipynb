        "\n",
        "Core ECS concepts:\n",
        "- **Cluster**: a logical grouping where you run workloads.\n",
        "- **Task definition**: the blueprint for running containers (image, CPU/memory, env vars, ports, IAM roles, logging).\n",
        "- **Task**: a running instance of a task definition (one or more containers).\n",
        "- **Service**: keeps a desired number of tasks running and supports rolling deployments + health checks.\n",
        "\n",
        "How ECS gets compute:\n",
        "- **Fargate**: serverless compute for containers (you don\u2019t manage EC2 instances).\n",
        "- **EC2 launch type**: you run ECS tasks on your own EC2 instances (you manage capacity/patching/AMIs).\n",
        "\n",
        "Common integrations:\n",
        "- Container images in **ECR**\n",
        "- **IAM roles** for tasks (least-privilege access to S3, DynamoDB, etc.)\n",
        "- Logging to **CloudWatch Logs**\n",

        "- **Long-running services**: REST/GraphQL APIs, internal services, web apps.\n",

        "- **ML workloads**: model inference services, feature generation jobs, evaluation pipelines.\n",

        "Reasons to choose ECS:\n",
        "- Tight integration with AWS networking, IAM, and logging.\n",
