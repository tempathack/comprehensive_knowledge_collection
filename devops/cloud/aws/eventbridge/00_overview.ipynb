    "## What is EventBridge?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Amazon EventBridge** is a serverless **event bus** service that routes events between AWS services, your own applications, and SaaS providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Producers publish **events** (JSON payloads) to an **event bus**.\n",
    "- **Rules** match events using **event patterns** (filtering) or **schedules**.\n",
    "- Matched events are delivered to **targets** like Lambda, Step Functions, SQS/SNS, Kinesis, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "EventBridge is the successor to CloudWatch Events (most event routing features live in EventBridge today).\n"

    "## What is EventBridge used for (practically)?\n",
    "\n",
    "EventBridge is commonly used for **decoupling** systems and building **event-driven** architectures (publish events once, let multiple consumers react).\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical use cases:\n",
    "- **Event-driven microservices** (e.g., emit `OrderCreated`, `PaymentFailed`, etc.)\n",
    "- **Workflow triggers** (start Step Functions / Glue jobs / ETL / SageMaker pipelines when data arrives)\n",
    "- **Scheduling** (cron/rate rules for periodic jobs)\n",
    "- **Notifications & automation** (route important state changes to SNS/Slack via Lambda)\n",
    "- **Cross-account routing** to centralize event processing and governance\n",
    "\n",
    "For ML specifically, EventBridge is often used to trigger feature pipelines, batch inference, retraining jobs, and monitoring alerts.\n"

    "- **Event bus**: default bus, custom buses, and partner buses\n",
    "- **Event**: JSON with fields like `source`, `detail-type`, `detail`, `time`, etc.\n",
    "- **Rule**: an event pattern or schedule that selects events\n",
    "- **Target**: where matching events are delivered (Lambda, Step Functions, SQS, SNS, Kinesis, etc.)\n",
    "- **Permissions**: EventBridge must be allowed to invoke the target (resource policies/IAM)\n",
