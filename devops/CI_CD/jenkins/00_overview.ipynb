        "- Receives an event (commit/push/PR/webhook, schedule, manual trigger).\n",
        "- Schedules work (a pipeline/job) onto an available worker.\n",
        "- Runs steps (build/test/package/deploy) and stores results (logs, artifacts, reports).\n",

        "- **Continuous Integration**: compile/build, run unit/integration tests, run linters, create artifacts.\n",
        "- **Release pipelines**: versioning, packaging, creating release candidates, publishing artifacts.\n",
        "- **Continuous Delivery/Deployment**: deploy to environments (dev/stage/prod) with approvals.\n",
        "- **Automation hub**: scheduled jobs, infra tasks, one-off operational workflows.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why teams use it:\n",
        "- **Works anywhere** (self-hosted): on-prem, cloud, air-gapped environments.\n",
        "- **Flexible pipeline logic** (Pipeline-as-Code via `Jenkinsfile`).\n",
