# System Design — Overview

How systems scale, stay reliable, and evolve.

## Planned Tracks
- **Fundamentals** → latency, throughput, CAP, consistency.
- **Architectures** → microservices, event-driven, data pipelines.
- **Reliability** → SLOs, incident response, resilience.
- **Tradeoffs** → storage, compute, network constraints.
