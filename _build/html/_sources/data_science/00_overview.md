# Data Science — Overview

A structured map of data science topics in this collection. Each section contains notebooks with theory, intuition, and runnable examples (often with Plotly).

## Core Tracks
- **Statistics** → inference, hypothesis testing, distributions, Bayesian methods.
- **Machine Learning** → supervised/unsupervised, metrics, dimensionality reduction.
- **Deep Learning** → CNNs, RNNs, Transformers (tabular/vision/time series).
- **Time Series** → classical forecasting, state-space models, volatility models.
- **Reinforcement Learning** → algorithms from scratch + practical demos.

## How to Use This Section
- Start with **Statistics** if you want foundations.
- Use **Machine Learning** for algorithms + evaluation.
- For forecasting, jump to **Time Series** and the **sktime**-aligned algorithms.

## Navigation Tips
- Each notebook is self-contained but cross-links to prerequisites.
- Plotly charts are embedded where useful to make behavior visible.
