# Time Series — Overview

Forecasting, anomaly detection, and temporal modeling.

## Core Tracks
- **Classical Statistical** → AR, MA, ARIMA/SARIMA, ETS.
- **State Space** → Kalman filter/smoother.
- **Machine Learning** → feature‑based models, ensembles.
- **Deep Learning** → RNNs, Transformers.
- **sktime Algorithms** → structured catalog aligned with sktime.

## Notebook Pattern
Each algorithm includes intuition, equations, and interactive Plotly visuals.
