# sktime Estimator Registry - Full Catalog

This notebook builds a live catalog of all estimators registered in your local sktime install. It is the most reliable way to see the complete algorithm list because sktime evolves over time.

What you get:
- Full table of estimators with module path and key capability tags
- Counts by estimator scitype (forecaster, classifier, regressor, ...)
- Quick filters for task-focused exploration

If sktime is not installed, install it first and re-run the notebook to populate the catalog.
