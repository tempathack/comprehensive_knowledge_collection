# Machine Learning — Overview

Classical ML algorithms, evaluation, and dimensionality reduction.

## Core Tracks
- **Supervised Learning** → regression/classification methods.
- **Unsupervised Learning** → clustering, manifold learning.
- **Metrics** → model evaluation for tabular & time series.

## Notebook Pattern
Each algorithm includes:
- Intuition & math
- From‑scratch implementation
- Practical usage + plots
