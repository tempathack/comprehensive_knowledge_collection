# Deep Learning — Overview

Covers neural networks for tabular, time series, and vision data.

## Core Tracks
- **Tabular** → MLPs, embeddings, regularization.
- **Time Series** → RNNs, LSTM/GRU, temporal models.
- **Vision** → CNNs, ResNets, modern architectures.

## Notebook Pattern
Each notebook explains intuition, math, and a from‑scratch or PyTorch implementation with visualizations.
