    "## What is SQS?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)** is a fully managed **message queue** on AWS.\n",
    "\n",
    "It lets **producers** (services that create work) send messages to a **queue**, and **consumers** (services that do work) poll the queue and process those messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key properties:\n",
    "- **Decoupling**: producers and consumers do not need to know about each other.\n",
    "- **Buffering**: absorbs spikes by queueing work until consumers can catch up.\n",
    "- **Reliability**: messages are stored durably and can be retried.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQS supports two queue types:\n",
    "- **Standard**: very high throughput, **at-least-once** delivery, *best-effort* ordering.\n",
    "- **FIFO**: preserves **ordering** within a message group and supports **exactly-once processing** semantics *within SQS* via deduplication (still design consumers to be idempotent).\n"

    "## What is SQS used for (practically)?\n",
    "\n",
    "SQS is commonly used whenever you want **asynchronous** communication and to **decouple** systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical use cases:\n",
    "- **Background jobs** (image/video processing, report generation, email sending)\n",
    "- **Microservice decoupling** (service A submits work; service B processes it)\n",
    "- **Rate smoothing / burst handling** (queue buffers traffic spikes)\n",
    "- **Event-driven pipelines** (e.g., S3 event → enqueue → worker processes)\n",
    "- **Fan-out patterns** (SNS topic → multiple SQS queues → different consumers)\n",
    "- **ML/DS workflows** (enqueue feature computation, inference jobs, or data validation tasks)\n"

    "## Core concepts (minimum you should know)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Message**: a payload (up to 256 KB) + optional attributes.\n",
    "- **Visibility timeout**: after a consumer receives a message, it becomes temporarily hidden so other consumers don’t process it at the same time.\n",
    "- **Delete on success**: consumers should delete the message only after successful processing.\n",
    "- **At-least-once delivery** (Standard): duplicates can happen → make processing **idempotent**.\n",
    "- **Long polling**: reduce empty responses and cost by waiting for messages (`WaitTimeSeconds`).\n",
    "- **Dead-letter queue (DLQ)**: messages that fail repeatedly can be moved to a separate queue for inspection/replay.\n",
    "- **FIFO specifics**: ordered processing requires `MessageGroupId`; dedup uses `MessageDeduplicationId` (or content-based dedup).\n"
