    "## What RDS is\n",
    "**Amazon RDS** is AWS’s managed service for running **relational databases**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of you provisioning a VM, installing a database, patching it, backing it up, and setting up replication, RDS provides managed primitives like:\n",
    "- **DB instances** (compute + storage for a database engine)\n",
    "- **Automated backups** + **point-in-time restore**\n",
    "- **Snapshots** (manual backups)\n",
    "- **High availability** options (e.g., **Multi-AZ** deployments)\n",
    "- **Read replicas** (engine-dependent)\n",
    "- Monitoring/metrics (CloudWatch), maintenance windows, parameter groups\n",
    "\n",
    "RDS supports common engines such as **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, **MariaDB**, **Oracle**, **SQL Server**, and also **Amazon Aurora** (a managed, RDS-compatible engine).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What it is not\n",
    "- Not a data lake (that’s typically S3-based).\n",
    "- Not a distributed OLAP warehouse by default (for that, consider services like Redshift).\n",
    "- Not “serverless SQL” by default (though some engine options provide serverless/autoscaling modes).\n"

    "## What RDS is practically used for\n",
    "RDS is commonly used when you need a **durable, transactional (OLTP) database** without running the operational burden yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical use-cases:\n",
    "- **Application backends**: user accounts, orders, payments, inventory, session/state.\n",
    "- **Metadata stores**: tracking datasets, experiments, jobs, model versions, feature definitions.\n",
    "- **Feature serving (lightweight)**: storing curated features for online inference when latency is important and the dataset fits relational access patterns.\n",
    "- **Internal tools**: dashboards, admin panels, workflow orchestration state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operational reasons to choose RDS:\n",
    "- You want managed backups, patching, monitoring, and HA options.\n",
    "- You want predictable relational semantics (constraints, joins, ACID transactions).\n",
    "- You want standard SQL drivers/tools (psql, mysql client, ORM tooling).\n"
