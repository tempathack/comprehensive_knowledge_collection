    "## What Snowflake is\n",
    "**Snowflake** is a cloud-native **data platform** primarily used as a managed **analytical data warehouse**.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, Snowflake provides:\n",
    "- **SQL** for querying and transforming data (plus support for semi-structured data).\n",
    "- Separation of **storage** and **compute** (you scale compute independently via *virtual warehouses*).\n",
    "- Elastic concurrency (multiple warehouses can query the same stored data).\n",
    "- Managed operations: encryption, scaling, caching, metadata services, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Snowflake concepts:\n",
    "- **Database / schema / table**: familiar organizational units (SQL).\n",
    "- **Virtual warehouse**: the compute cluster that runs queries.\n",
    "- **Stages**: locations for loading/unloading data (e.g., cloud object storage).\n",
    "- **Time Travel / zero-copy cloning**: point-in-time access and cheap copies for dev/test.\n",
    "- **Secure data sharing**: share data across accounts without copying.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What it is not\n",
    "- Not primarily an **OLTP** database (high-frequency transactions, ultra-low latency key/value access).\n",
    "- Not an application cache or message queue.\n"

    "Snowflake is commonly used as the central place to **store, transform, and analyze** data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical use-cases:\n",
    "- **Analytics + BI**: dashboards, reporting, KPIs, ad-hoc analysis.\n",
    "- **ELT pipelines**: load raw data, then transform it in-warehouse (often with tools like dbt).\n",
    "- **Data sharing**: share curated datasets between teams/partners without moving data.\n",
    "- **Feature/analytics datasets for ML**: create training datasets and run large SQL feature engineering jobs.\n",
    "- **Governance + access control**: centralized permissions, masking policies, auditing.\n"
