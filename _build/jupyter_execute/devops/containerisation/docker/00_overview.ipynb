    "\n",
    "**Docker** is a platform for building, distributing, and running **containerized applications**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key pieces:\n",
    "- **Docker Engine**: the runtime that creates and manages containers.\n",
    "- **Docker daemon (`dockerd`)**: a background service that talks to the OS and container runtime.\n",
    "- **Docker CLI (`docker`)**: the command-line client that calls the daemon API.\n",
    "- **Images**: immutable templates (built from layers) used to create containers.\n",
    "- **Registries**: places to store/pull images (Docker Hub, ECR, GHCR, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "What it is not:\n",
    "- Not a VM: containers share the host kernel (they are isolated processes with a packaged filesystem).\n",
    "- Not a configuration-management tool by itself (OS config often uses cloud-init/Ansible/etc.).\n"

    "\n",
    "On Linux, Docker runs containers using kernel primitives:\n",
    "- **Namespaces** isolate views of the system (PID, network, mounts, UTS hostname, IPC, user).\n",
    "- **cgroups** enforce resource limits (CPU, memory, IO).\n",
    "- **Union filesystem** (often OverlayFS) provides image layers + copy-on-write.\n",
    "\n",
    "Image layers and copy-on-write:\n",
    "- An image is a stack of read-only layers.\n",
    "- A container adds a small read-write layer on top.\n",
    "- Deleting the container deletes that writable layer (unless you used volumes/bind mounts).\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is OCI-aligned:\n",
    "- Images are commonly OCI-compatible.\n",
    "- Under the hood Docker typically uses components like `containerd` and an OCI runtime (`runc`).\n"

    "## Networking: how container IPs work\n",
    "\n",
    "### The default mental model (Linux)\n",
    "- Each container gets its own **network namespace**.\n",
    "- Docker creates a **veth pair** (virtual ethernet cable):\n",
    "  - one end becomes `eth0` inside the container namespace\n",
    "  - the other end stays on the host and connects to a Linux bridge\n",
    "- The bridge (often `docker0` or a user-defined bridge) acts like a virtual switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outbound traffic (container → internet):\n",
    "- Containers usually get private IPs (e.g., `172.17.0.0/16`).\n",
    "- Docker configures NAT (iptables) so container traffic is masqueraded through the host.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inbound traffic (internet → container):\n",
    "- `-p 8080:80` publishes a port by adding a DNAT rule:\n",
    "  - host `:8080` → containerIP `:80`\n",
    "- Publishing is explicit; without it, services are reachable only from the host or other containers on the same network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Networks you’ll actually use\n",
    "- **User-defined bridge networks** (recommended for local multi-container apps):\n",
    "  - built-in DNS lets containers resolve each other by name\n",
    "  - better isolation vs the default `bridge`\n",
    "- **host** network: container shares host network namespace (no port mapping; fewer isolation guarantees).\n",
    "- **none**: no networking.\n",
    "- **overlay**: multi-host networking (typically with Swarm; Kubernetes uses its own CNI).\n",
    "\n",
    "DNS:\n",
    "- On user-defined networks, Docker provides an embedded DNS server (commonly reachable at `127.0.0.11` inside containers).\n",
    "- Container names (and Compose service names) resolve to container IPs on that network.\n"

    "### 1) Named volumes (managed by Docker)\n",
    "- Created and lifecycle-managed by Docker.\n",
    "- On Linux (rootful), data typically lives under `/var/lib/docker/volumes/...`.\n",
    "- Can use volume drivers for remote storage.\n",

    "### 2) Bind mounts (host path → container path)\n",
    "- You mount a specific directory/file from the host.\n",
    "- Great for local development (live-edit code on host).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run --rm -it \\\n",
