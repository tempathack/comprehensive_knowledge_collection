    "## What is Terraform?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Terraform** is an Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tool that lets you define infrastructure in configuration files and then **create / update / destroy** real resources via provider APIs (AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, GitHub, Datadog, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Terraform configurations describe the **desired end state** (what you want). Terraform computes the set of actions needed to reach that state.\n"

   "id": "b2e1d5f9",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Core principles (mental model)\n",
    "- **Declarative configuration**: you describe target resources and their properties; Terraform calculates the change.\n",
    "- **Providers**: plugins that translate resources into API calls (e.g., `aws_s3_bucket` → AWS S3 API).\n",
    "- **State**: Terraform records what it previously created in a state file (local or remote). State is how Terraform knows what to change.\n",
    "- **Plan → Apply safety**: `terraform plan` shows a diff (create/update/delete) before mutating real infrastructure.\n",
    "- **Dependency graph**: Terraform builds a graph from references to order operations safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful picture:\n",
    "`config (HCL) + state  →  plan (diff)  →  apply (API calls)  →  new state`\n"

    "- Provision cloud infrastructure: networks, compute, storage, databases, IAM.\n",

    "- Standardize architecture patterns via **modules** (reusable building blocks).\n",

    "Why teams use it:\n",
    "- **Version control + code review** for infra changes (PRs).\n",
    "- **Consistency** across dev/stage/prod.\n",
    "- **Drift detection**: compare desired config vs the real resources.\n",

    "## Pitfalls & quick tips\n",
    "- Treat state as **sensitive** (it can contain secrets/identifiers). Use remote backends + encryption + access control.\n",
    "- Pin provider versions and avoid surprise upgrades.\n",
    "- Prefer `for_each` with stable keys (avoid index-based `count` when ordering can change).\n",
    "- Use modules to encode best practices (tags, naming, logging, encryption defaults).\n",
    "- Separate environments cleanly and avoid cross-env coupling via state unless intentional.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "- Write a module that creates an S3 bucket with versioning + encryption + public access blocked.\n",
    "- Add a remote backend configuration (S3 + DynamoDB lock) and explain why locking matters.\n",
    "- Import an existing bucket with `terraform import` and run `plan` to see drift.\n",
