    "## What is Pulumi?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pulumi** is an Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) platform where infrastructure is defined using **general-purpose programming languages** instead of a dedicated DSL.\n",
    "\n",
    "You write a Pulumi program that declares cloud resources (AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, SaaS providers, etc.). Pulumi then computes the changes needed and performs an update by calling provider APIs.\n"

   "id": "d0e7a2c6",

   "source": [
    "## Core principles (mental model)\n",
    "- **Infrastructure as real code**: use loops, functions, packages, tests, and type systems (depending on language).\n",
    "- **Declarative outcome, imperative expression**: you write code, but Pulumi builds a **resource graph** (desired state) from it.\n",
    "- **Preview → Update safety**: `pulumi preview` shows the diff before applying changes with `pulumi up`.\n",
    "- **Stacks + state**: each environment (dev/stage/prod) is typically a **stack** with its own state.\n",
    "- **Outputs**: many values are only known after creation (IDs, ARNs, endpoints). Pulumi models these as `Output` values.\n",
    "- **Config + secrets**: runtime configuration is per-stack; secrets are encrypted and stored with the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful picture:\n",
    "`program (code) + config + state  →  preview (diff)  →  up (API calls)  →  new state`\n"

    "## What is Pulumi used for (practically)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pulumi is a strong fit when you want IaC, but you also want the power of a full programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common uses:\n",
    "- Provision cloud infrastructure: networks, compute, storage, databases, IAM.\n",
    "- Manage Kubernetes and platform tooling with code-level abstractions.\n",
    "- Build higher-level building blocks (\"components\") that hide complexity and enforce standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why teams use it:\n",
    "- **Better abstractions**: loops/conditionals and shared libraries can reduce duplication.\n",
    "- **Single-language workflow**: teams can use familiar tooling (linters, type checking, tests).\n",
    "- **Policy + guardrails**: enforce org rules (e.g., “all buckets must have encryption”).\n",
    "- **Multi-cloud + SaaS**: unify provisioning across many providers.\n"

    "- **Component**: a reusable abstraction composed of multiple resources.\n",

    "## Pitfalls & quick tips\n",
    "- Understand `Output` values: you often can’t use resource outputs like normal strings until they’re resolved.\n",
    "- Keep secrets out of plain outputs/logs; assume state may contain sensitive metadata.\n",
    "- Make resource naming deterministic and stable to avoid accidental replacements.\n",
    "- Prefer small, well-tested components over copy-pasting patterns across projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "- Create a component that provisions an S3 bucket with encryption + versioning + public access blocked.\n",
    "- Add stack configs for `dev` and `prod` and show how they differ safely.\n",
