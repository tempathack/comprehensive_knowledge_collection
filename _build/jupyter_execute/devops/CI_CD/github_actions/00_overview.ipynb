    "- Know **why** teams use it (tight GitHub integration, managed runners, ecosystem).\n",

    "## What is GitHub Actions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**GitHub Actions** is GitHub's native automation platform for CI/CD and general workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "You define automation in **workflow YAML** files stored in your repository:\n",
    "- Path: `.github/workflows/<name>.yml`\n",
    "- Triggers: GitHub events (push, pull_request, release), schedules, or manual dispatch.\n",
    "- Execution: one or more **jobs** running on **runners** (GitHub-hosted or self-hosted).\n"

    "## What is it used for (and why teams choose it)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Common uses:\n",
    "- CI: build, unit/integration tests, linting, formatting checks.\n",
    "- Security checks: dependency scanning, SAST, secret scanning (often integrated with GitHub).\n",
    "- CD: deploy on merge/tag with environment approvals.\n",
    "- Automation: issue/PR triage, release notes, scheduled maintenance tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why teams use it:\n",
    "- **First-class GitHub integration** (PR checks, statuses, code owners, environments).\n",
    "- **Managed runners** available instantly; easy scaling for typical workloads.\n",
    "- Large ecosystem of reusable actions + marketplace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why teams avoid it:\n",
    "- If you are not on GitHub (or have strict network/hosting constraints), it may not fit.\n",
    "- Self-hosted runners require careful isolation and security hardening.\n"

    "Key mechanics:\n",
    "- Each job runs in a **fresh VM/container** on GitHub-hosted runners (ephemeral by default).\n",
    "- Jobs can run in parallel; `needs:` expresses dependencies.\n",
    "- Steps are either shell commands (`run:`) or reusable components (`uses:`).\n",
    "- Secrets are injected from GitHub (repo/org/environment secrets).\n",
    "- Permissions to GitHub APIs can be controlled via `permissions:` and the `GITHUB_TOKEN`.\n"
