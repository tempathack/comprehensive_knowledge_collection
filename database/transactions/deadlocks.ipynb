    "\n",
    "2. **Wait-For Graph** is the standard method for deadlock detection — a cycle indicates deadlock\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Lock ordering** is the simplest prevention strategy — all transactions acquire locks in the same global order\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Timeouts** provide a practical fallback — transactions that wait too long are aborted\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Wait-Die/Wound-Wait** use timestamps to ensure progress — older transactions have priority\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Victim selection** should minimize wasted work while preventing starvation\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Trade-off**: Prevention limits concurrency but avoids detection overhead; Detection allows more concurrency but requires resolution\n",
